Project Overview: Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer
The Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based project designed to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. It leverages the power of deep learning using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to understand the context and meaning of the reviews.

The system is trained on a labeled dataset of movie reviews and is capable of classifying unseen reviews with high accuracy. It includes a user-friendly web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input any movie review and instantly receive sentiment feedback.

Key Features:

Uses pre-trained BERT for contextual understanding of language.

Implements NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.

Provides a responsive front-end for real-time user interaction.

Offers high accuracy and performance in sentiment classification.
